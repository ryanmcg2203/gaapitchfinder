# The Heights of Gaelic Games: Analyzing Elevation Data of GAA Pitches Worldwide

When you think of the GAA (Gaelic Athletic Association), you might picture the rolling hills of Ireland, but did you know that GAA pitches can be found from below sea level to high up in the mountains? We've recently analyzed elevation data for nearly 2,000 GAA pitches worldwide, and the results are fascinating.

## The High and Low of It

Imagine playing a match in Amsterdam, where the Amsterdam GAC's pitch sits 3 meters *below* sea level. Now contrast that with the Butte Wolfe Tones Hurling Club in the North Western Division of the United States, where players compete at a breathtaking 1,741 meters above sea level â€“ that's higher than many European ski resorts!

## Breaking Down the Numbers

The average GAA pitch sits at a modest 73 meters above sea level, but this simple number masks an incredible variety. Here's what we found:

- **Median elevation**: 60 meters (half of all pitches are above this, half below)
- **The middle 50%**: Most pitches fall between 28 and 92 meters
- **Variation**: With a standard deviation of 94 meters, there's huge diversity in pitch locations

## Global Heights: The Highest Counties

Some of the most elevated GAA communities might surprise you:

1. **North Western Division (USA)**: Average elevation of 599m
   - Home to 8 pitches, including our record-holder in Butte
2. **Saudi Arabia**: A single pitch at 592m
3. **Canberra (Australia)**: One pitch at 585m
4. **Switzerland**: Three pitches averaging 366m
5. **Southwest Division**: 9 pitches with an average elevation of 278m

## What Does This Tell Us About GAA's Global Reach?

This elevation data paints a picture of GAA's remarkable global adaptation. From below sea level in the Netherlands to the heights of the American West, Gaelic games are being played in environmental conditions the founding members of the GAA could hardly have imagined.

The distribution shows that while most pitches are at relatively modest elevations (fitting for the sport's Irish origins), GAA clubs have established themselves in some of the world's most diverse geographical locations. It's a testament to the sport's adaptability and the dedication of its global community.

## Looking Forward

This analysis opens up interesting questions about how elevation might affect play. Do teams at higher elevations have a home advantage due to the thinner air? How do players adjust when moving between pitches with significant elevation differences? These questions might make for fascinating future research.
