## Notable Findings
1. Rainfall variation across counties
   - Highest county average: Kerry (1491.9mm)
   - Lowest county average: Norway (0.0mm)
   - Range: 1491.9mm

2. Regional patterns
   - Western counties tend to have higher rainfall
   - Eastern counties generally show lower rainfall
   - Coastal areas typically experience more rainfall than inland regions

3. Implications for GAA
   - Higher rainfall areas may need more robust drainage systems
   - Consider artificial surfaces in particularly wet regions
   - Match scheduling might need to account for regional rainfall patterns
